When you configure a virtual machine in VMWare Fusion by default it runs the machine with one virtual processor.

I was curious to see if running with two processors would make a difference so I ran a quick test using my software build time as a benchmark. Runing with a single processor the build time was 140 seconds, running with two it dropped to 118 seconds, a decrease of about 15%.
