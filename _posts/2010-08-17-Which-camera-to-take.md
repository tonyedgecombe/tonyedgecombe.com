We just got back from our summer holidays in northern Italy, as we were travelling around quite a bit I wanted to travel as light as possible so didn't take my SLR. This time we made do with a Canon G9 and the camera in my iPhone 3GS.

I have been pleasantly surprised by the camera in the phone, obviously it isn't near the G9 but it can take remarkably good photographs. It took my a little while to figure out that you can specify what part of the photograph to meter on, just touch the display on the subject of the image. There is a reasonable amount of noise in poorly lit photos but on the whole it is very good for a phone.

There is an iPhone app called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/best-camera/id329800600?mt=8">Best Camera</a> which is good at editing and uploading photos to Flickr although it does seem to loose some EXIF data.
