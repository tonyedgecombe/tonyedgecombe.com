64-Bit versions of Windows have been available for some time now but it's only in the last week that I have started getting requests for a 64-bit version of Print Distributor. Microsoft announced this week the next version of Windows on the desktop will be 64-bit only.

It looks like a fairly small change to the code and a recompile of the port monitor is all I need although I'm going to take the opportunity to pull wxWidgets out of the port monitor at the same time.
