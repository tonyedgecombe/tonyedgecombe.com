Welcome to my blog, I post here about programming and printer software.

I'm a software developer working for [myself](http://www.frogmorecs.com) writing [printing](http://www.printdistributor.com) [tools](http://www.mail-print.com).

I code mostly in C++ and Python.

I work from a [small rented office](http://www.flickr.com/photos/edgecombe/2701227174/) at [Grove Technology Park](http://www.grovetechpark.com/) in [Wantage](http://www.wantage.com).
