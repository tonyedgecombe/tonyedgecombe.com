I've just about finished fitting new composite doors to the front and rear of my house. The old doors have never really fitted well, in the winter the wind blew straight through the house. We bought the doors online and I fitted them myself, this is the most difficult diy job I would tackle.

I made a few mistakes on the first door but the second went in easily. We originally had a quote for £5,500 for replacement solid wood doors, by switching to composite and fitting them myself the cost came down to about £1,300. The finish is very good, you wouldn't know they aren't wood and they have the big advantage of stability when the weather changes. I'm looking forward to a draft free winter.
