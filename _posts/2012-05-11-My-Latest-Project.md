This week I released my latest project, [Folder Agent.](http://www.folderagent.com/) It is a Windows application that monitors a folder or directory for new and modified files. It then lets you run actions against that modified file such as copying, moving, emailing or deleting the file. You can also run an external program or script against the file.

There is a template system that lets you build paths and properties dynamically, so you could move files to a folder structure based on the date for instance.

I've been thinking about writing something along these lines for a long time, in fact I first registered the domain in 2005 but was never really satisified with my first few attempts. This time I started by focussing on the core functionality rather than the user interface and the whole thing has come together quickly, in fact from start to finish was only three months.
