No matter how enlightened my previous employers have been there was always an expectation that at a minimum I would be keeping my seat warm all day. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, measuring the output of programmers is hard, if not impossible, so it shouldn't have been a surprise that my managers fell back to more visible metrics like whether I was in the office.

This usually meant a schedule of working through the morning when I was most productive, then spending the afternoon trying to look busy having used most of my mental energy earlier in the day. 

Probably the most significant benefit of working for myself is I can jettison this nonsense and follow a schedule that coincides with my natural work rhythms rather than working against them. My normal schedule is to work solidly on programming tasks for the first three hours of the day, then check my support email. My afternoon is work free, then I check email again in the evening to mop up any support requests from customers in later time zones.

Although three hours doesn't seem much I have found that as long as I stay focussed I can get a huge amount done and I don't tend to make the silly mistakes that occur when I am tired and that end up wasting effort fixing them later.
