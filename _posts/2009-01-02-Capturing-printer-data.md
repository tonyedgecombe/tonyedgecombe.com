[Print Distributor](http://www.printdistributor.com) is pretty flexible at capturing print streams, as well as handling Windows applications it's easy to setup printing from AS400, UNIX and mainframes.

I do occasionally get requests to capture data from a serial or parallel port, usually from some closed or embedded application. Often these closed systems have no mechanism to export data so people want to capture reports as a export mechanism.

Up till now I haven't been able to suggest a solution however I just came across [Photologic](http://www.photologic.ca/) run by Rick Hoffman, Rick has some interesting hardware "glue" which looks like it will help these customers.
